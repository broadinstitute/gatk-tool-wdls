# gatk-tool-wdls

Autogenerated WDLs for GATK Tools

This repository contains auto-generated WDL wrappers for individual tools in the [Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK)](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk).
The intention is that these WDLs can be imported as tasks into larger workflows consisting of multiple tools run as a pipeline.

Each set of WDLs published here is tagged with the GATK release version that they were generated from. You should match the version
of the WDLs with the version of GATK that you are running.

A `.dockstore.yml` file is also provided for integration with [Dockstore](dockstore.org)
